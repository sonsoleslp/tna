# Example Long Data on Group Regulation

Students' regulation during collaborative learning. This is the same
dataset as `group_regulation` but in long format. In addition to
students' actions (`Action`), it contains the student identifier
(`Actor`), timestamp (`Time`), `Course` name, and collaboration `Group`.
It also includes a column (`Achiever`) indicating whether the student is
a high or low achiever.

## Usage

``` r
group_regulation_long
```

## Format

A `data.frame` object.

## Source

The data was generated synthetically from `group_regulation`
