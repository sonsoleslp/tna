# Plot Communities

This function visualizes the communities detected within a `tna` object
based on different community detection algorithms and their
corresponding color mappings.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'tna_communities'
plot(x, colors, method = "spinglass", ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `communities` object generated by the `find_communities` method.
  Each community detection method maps nodes or points in to a specific
  communities.

- colors:

  A `character` vector of color values used for visualizing community
  assignments.

- method:

  A `character` string naming a community detection method to use for
  coloring the plot. See
  [`communities()`](http://sonsoles.me/tna/reference/communities.md) for
  details.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`qgraph::qgraph()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/qgraph/man/qgraph.html).

## Value

A `qgraph` object in which the nodes are colored by community.
