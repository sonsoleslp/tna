Captures higher-order transitions considering sequences n states, useful identifying longer patterns. \"gap\" allows transitions non-adjacent states, transitions weighted gap size. \"reverse\" considers sequences reverse order (resulting called reply network contexts). resulting weight matrix transpose \"frequency\" option. \"attention\" aggregates downstream pairs states exponential decay gap states. parameter lambda can used control decay rate (default 1)- scaling character vector describing scale weights defined type. vector provided, scaling options applied respective order. example, c(\"rank\", \"minmax\") first compute ranks, scale unit interval using min-max normalization. empty vector corresponds scaling. Currently supports following options: \"minmax\" performs min-max normalization scale weights unit interval. Note smallest weight positive, zero scaling. \"max\" Multiplies weights reciprocal largest weight scale weights unit interval. options preserves positive ranks, unlike \"minmax\" weights positive. \"rank\" Computes ranks weights using base::rank() ties.method = \"average\". groupwise logical value indicates whether scaling methods applied group (TRUE) globally (FALSE, default). cols expression giving tidy selection columns considered sequence data. default columns. columns automatically determined tna_data objects. group column automatically removed columns provided. params list additional arguments models specific type. potential elements list : n_gram: integer n-gram transitions specifying number adjacent events. default value 2. max_gap: integer gap-allowed transitions specifying largest allowed gap size. default 1. windowed: Perform model estimation window. Supported relative, frequency co-occurrence types. window_size: integer sliding window transitions specifying window size. default 2. window_type: character string defines window type. Either \"rolling\" \"tumbling\". weighted: logical value. TRUE, transitions weighted inverse sequence length. Can used frequency, co-occurrence reverse model types. default FALSE. direction: character string specifying direction attention models type = \"attention\". available options \"backward\", \"forward\", \"\", backward attention, forward attention, bidirectional attention, respectively. default \"forward\". decay: function specifies decay weights two time points specific distance. function take three arguments: , j lambda, j numeric vectors time values, lambda  numeric value decay rate. function return numeric vector weights. default function(, j, lambda) exp(-abs(- j) / lambda). lambda: numeric value decay rate. default 1. time: matrix data.frame providing time values sequence time index. tna_data objects, can also logical value, TRUE use time_data element x time values. Date values converted numeric. duration: matrix data.frame providing time spent state sequence time index. alternative time. concat integer number consecutive sequences concatenate. default 1 (concatenation). na.rm logical value determines observations NA value group removed.
